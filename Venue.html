            <p class="paperCall2 px-2 pb-4">Amer Fort is situated in a town called Amer which is located at around 11km from Jaipur. The fort is built on
               Hindu architectural background having gates, temples, palaces, and other structures. For providing water inside
               the fort, there is a Maota Lake nearby. The materials used in the construction of the fort are marble and red
               sandstone. The fort is also known as Amer Palace due to the presence of temples and gardens.</p>

            <p class="paperCall2 px-3">Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II established the City Palace in 1727 along with the city of Jaipur, when he moved
              his court to Jaipur from Amber. This was necessitated by an increase in population and water shortage and until
               1949 the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur.The palace complex,
               which lies in the heart of the city, is a unique and arresting complex of several courtyards, buildings, pavilions,
               gardens, and temples and now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, continuing to be the home
               of the Jaipur royal family.</p>

            <p class="paperCall2 px-2 pb-4">Jal Mahal is a palace in the middle of the man-made Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur. Raja Man Singh
              constructed  both the palace and the lake in 1610 damming River Dravyavati, which was later
              enlarged in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber.
              Jal Mahal palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture with a
              picturesque view of the lake. Built in red sandstone, it is a five-storied building, of which four
              floors remain underwater when the lake is full with the top floor exposed.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center py-1 text-info opacity-75">Hawa Mahal</h3>
            <p class="paperCall2 px-2">The Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur. Built with the red and pink sandstone by Maharaja Sawai
              Pratap Singh in 1799, It is on the edge of the City Palace and extends to the ‘Zenana’ or women's
              chambers. It is a 50 feet high, five-storey, pyramidal monument built akin to a honeycomb with
              its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.
              The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and
               festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules
              of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This
              architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making
              the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.
              The palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements,
              and arched roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot.</p>

              Aravalli range; it overlooks the Amer Fort and the Maota Lake, near Amer in Jaipur.
              The fort was built by Jai Singh II in 1726 to protect the Amer Fort and its palace complex and
              was named after him. The fort features a cannon named "Jaivana”, which was manufactured in
              the fort precincts and was then the world's largest cannon on wheels.</p>

              Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, it once
              formed a strong defense ring for the city.
              The fort originally named Sudarshangarh became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of
              tigers' and was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city.
              Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications that connected this fort to
              Jaigarh</p>

              museum of Rajasthan. The building, a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture got its name
              from the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, because of the similarity of architecture.
              Opened as a public museum in 1887, it was initially planned as a town hall, but later Madho
              Singh II decided it should be a museum for the art of Jaipur and included as part of the new Ram
              Nivas Garden.The museum has a rich collection of artifacts including paintings, jewelry, carpets, ivory, stone,
              metal sculptures, and works in crystal. The collection includes coins from the Gupta, Kushan,

              machine" and mantar, "consult, calculate". Therefore, Jantar Mantar literally means 'calculating
