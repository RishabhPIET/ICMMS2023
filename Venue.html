            <h3>City Palace</h3>
            <p>Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II established the City Palace in 1727 along with the city of Jaipur, when he moved
              his<br> court to Jaipur from Amber. This was necessitated by an increase in population and water shortage and until
               1949 <br>the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur.The palace complex,
               which<br> lies in the heart of the city, is a unique and arresting complex of several courtyards, buildings, pavilions,
               gardens,<br> and temples and now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, continuing to be the home
               of the Jaipur<br> royal family.</p>

            <h3>Jal mahal</h3>
            <p>Jal Mahal is a palace in the middle of the man-made Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur. Raja Man Singh
              constructed  both<br> the palace and the lake in 1610 damming River Dravyavati, which was later
              enlarged in the 18th century by<br> Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber.
              Jal Mahal palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture <br>with a
              picturesque view of the lake. Built in red sandstone, it is a five-storied building, of which four
              floors remain<br> underwater when the lake is full with the top floor exposed.</p>

            <h3>Hawa mahal</h3>
            <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur. Built with the red and pink sandstone by Maharaja Sawai
              Pratap Singh in<br> 1799, It is on the edge of the City Palace and extends to the ‘Zenana’ or women's
              chambers. It is a 50 feet high,<br> five-storey, pyramidal monument built akin to a honeycomb with
              its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated <br>with intricate latticework.
              The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life<br>and
               festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules
              of "purdah",<br> which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This
              architectural feature also allowed cool air<br> from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making
              the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in<br> summer.
              The palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements,
              and arched <br>roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has
              delicately modelled hanging cornices</p>

              was named after him. The fort features a cannon named "Jaivana”, which was manufactured<br> in

              museum of Rajasthan.<br> The building, a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture got its name
              from the Victoria and Albert Museum of<br> London, because of the similarity of architecture.
              Opened as a public museum in 1887, it was initially planned as a <br>town hall, but later Madho
              Singh II decided it should be a museum for the art of Jaipur and included as part of the<br> new Ram
              Nivas Garden.The museum has a rich collection of artifacts including paintings, jewelry, carpets, ivory, stone,<br>
              metal sculptures, and works in crystal. The collection includes coins from the Gupta, Kushan,

            <p>Located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal, the Jantar Mantar, a UNESCO World Heritage site,
              is a collection of<br> nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the Kachwaha Rajput
              king Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder<br> of Jaipur. The monument, built from local stone and marble,
               bronze tablets, bricks and mortar was completed in <br>1734 and features the world's largest stone sundial.
              The monument spread over about 18,700 square metres gets <br>its name from jantar, "instrument,
              machine" and mantar, "consult, calculate". Therefore, Jantar Mantar literally means<br> 'calculating
              instrument'.</p>
